                        That is not all folks, we will also conduct our Spook-Tacular Halloween Festival Costume Competition. From 5:00pm all the way till the end of the festival we host a small scale costume competition where you have the opportunity to show off your costume to everyone in the crowd! There is only one prize (that will be revealed on the day) that you can win and you will be judge by these simple criterias:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        How cool/well designed are the costumes (bonus marks if you personally made the costume yourself)
                        <br>
                        How much cheers were you able to gather from the audience
                        <br>
                        Are you cosplaying a unique/popular/niche fictional character
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Disclaimer: Any costumes that are deemed NSFW (showing a lot of skin) will be immediately disqualified. Also no dangerous weapons/realistic weapons are allow inside of the Halloween Festival. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There are no forms that you need to sign before the festival, just get dressed and rock up to the festival at 4:30pm to sign yourself into the festival. All we will need is your name and you will need to declare whether your costume was made by you or not. I would recommend for participants to dress up in their costumes right before the sign up session has started.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Sign up session time: 4:30pm - 4:45pm 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The official costume competition will start at 5:00pm 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The competition is predicted to be finished by 6:00pm, the exact time where the Halloween Festival will be finished
